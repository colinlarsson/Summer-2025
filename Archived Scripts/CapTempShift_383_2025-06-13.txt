' Name: Capacitance Based Temp Shift for Project 383 with intY
' Description: This script shifts the temperature setpoint based on capacitance criteria and time limits, using intY to track stages.
' Author: Brendan McGuire, Colin Larsson
' Updates: 2025-06-17 added rampstart and waitstart to track time in each stage CL
' Updated: 2025-06-18 array a(22) to leverage persistent array s(22) to keep rampStart and waitStart persistent CL

dim timeLimit as double = 68  ' hour limit on the shift
dim initialTemp as double = 36 'initial temperature
dim tempTarget as double = 32  'temp to shift to
dim rampDuration as double = 2   'ramp the temp shift over time in hours
dim capOverTime as double = 0.5 'in hours, how long must the capacitance be over the limit?
dim rampEndTime as double = 1 ' empty for now but will contain the end time of the ramping

dim waitStart as double = 0
dim rampStart as double = 0
'dim .intY as integer ' this is the stage of the temp shift, 0 = initial, 1 = wait, 2 = ramping, 3 = done
